# Melissa Barrera's Portfolio 

## Description 
This portfolio was created to show off the skills I've learned while studying at the UC Berkely Extension's coding bootcamp! It is a SPA (single-page application) where you can learn a little about me, go over my resume, my portfolio, and a way to contact me. All created using React!
